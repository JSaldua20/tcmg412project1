<p>	Howdy, we created this webpage for a group project where we split into a Dev team and an Ops team. On the Dev team was Jonathan and Tanner. Julia and Joshua worked on the deployment of the webpage and were on the Ops team. On this webpage we'll discuss some information on golden retrievers.
</p>
<p>	The Golden Retriever is a medium to large sized dog that is commonly known for being the best family pet. It was bred to retrieve things like duck and game birds while their owners hunt. They are perfect for this since they have a soft mouth. Instinctively, they love water, and are easy to train obedience standards. They are normally a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides warmth and an outer coat that repels water. They normally shed at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.
</p>
<p>The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. They are also trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed in the United States. Golden Retrievers require a lot of daily exercise. The breed enjoys playing a lot, but is also easily trainable.
